1)  Intro Screen #2:   needs the accent marks over certain vowels in the names for the areas of Endemism.  See attached Skitch.

2)  Intro Screens #3 & #4:  please remove the highlighting below the river in the unnamed region of endemism.  Only Napo and Imeri should have the reddish highlighting over them. See attached Skitches.

  1)  Intro Screen #4:  In the first line of the first paragraph, "Jason" should be plural:  Jason's (with an apostrophe s).  Also, in the 6th line of the first paragraph, there's an extra "at" in the sentence that needs to be deleted.  (See attached Skitch.)

=======

  2)  Site #1 Main Map:  The left trail needs to touch the river's edge, and there's still a typo in the text on the right (it's "study" not "studio").  See attached Skitch.

  A)  White-flanked Antwren:  In the first paragraph, please delete the extra space at the end of the first sentence, so that there's only one space between sentences, not two.  (See attached Skitch.)

  B)  Bicolored Antbird:  Several italizations were missed in the text edits -- see Skitch.

  C)  Barred Forest Falcon:  There's a new change here -- sorry, it's been a bit of a controversy about what they want to call it, song or call, and they've decided to have it match Xenocanto's label.

  The red box should say "Song" not "Call"

  Also, the Audio Popup Title should say "Barred Forest Falcon Song"

============

  3)  Site #2 Main Map:  The birds still need to be reordered according to the Skitch, see attached.
  Also, the pinpoint for the Black-necked Red Continga needs to be on the other side of the trail.

  A)  Golden-headed Manakin:  New change here, the red box should say "Song" not "Lekking Call"

  B)  White-crowned Manakin:  the scientific name of this specie is another hotly debated issue.  They want to go back to old scientific name of Dixiphia pipra, not Pipra pipra, so that it matches the Xenocanto audio file.

============

  4)  Site #3 Main Map:  The birds still need to be reordered according to the Skitch, see attached.
  Also, there are several edits that were missed in the text on the right (see attached Skitch.)

  A)  Yellow-billed Jacamar:  Sorry, I misread their notes and gave you the wrong audio link for this bird.  It should link to http://www.xeno-canto.org/61841.

  B)  Cream-colored Woodpecker:  looks like when you imported the new third paragraph, the beginning of the sentence got lopped off.  It should begin "We don't yet know if these woodpecker" (see attached Skitch)

  Also, it's linking to the wrong audio file.  It should be http://www.xeno-canto.org/28174

  C)  Black-headed Parrot:  Several edits to the text still need to be made, so I've re-attached the Skitch
