1)  Crosshairs:
  It seems that white-line "crosshairs" appear across all the maps, including the intro maps as well as the site maps, when you view the interactive in Firefox.  Sometimes the horizontal line appears and disappears as you scroll up and down the site maps.  (See attached screenshots.)  The crosshairs do not appear at all when you view the interactive in Chrome or Safari.  Can we either remove the crosshairs or make them consistent on all browsers?

  I am unable to replicate this via Mac Firefox V. 21. This could be a problem with the browser itself without being able to replicate the problem I will not be able to debug it.

2)  Main Intro Maps Screen 3 -- The Napo & the Imeri:  Please change the first paragraph of this intro text on the right side of the map to read:

      Travel up Brazil’s Rio Japurá and its tributaries with Field Museum scientists John Bates and Jason Weckstein and Goeldi Museum scientist Alex Aleixo to discover which birds live in a little-explored area where two Areas of Endemism meet—the Napo and the Imerí.

3)  Site 1:

a)  White-flanked Antwren:  Please move the pinpoint for this bird to the left about a quarter inch, so that it sits closer to the red line of the trail, rather than on the river bend.

b)  Bicolored Antbird:  Please change first paragraph to read:
Mixed-species flocks also specialize in certain habitats. Some search for food in seasonally flooded forests, while others hunt in Terra Firme (dry land) forests.

4)  Site 3 - Rio Acanaui:  can you change the second paragraph in the intro text on the right side of the main Site 3 map to read as follows:

We made our way through Igapo (forests flooded with acidic blackwater) and Campinarana (low, scrubby forest growing in nutrient-poor sandy soil) and finally found a higher patch of dry land (Terra Firme).
